Analyzed the stack overflow developers survey data for the last 11 years to observe the trends for the following questions:

- Which development environment/editor is most preferred/used?
- Which country is most popular among developers?
- How the growth rate (or rather % of females) have changed at the workplace?

Dataset used for this analysis could be downloaded from here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey
(please note that some files are >25mb in size, and Github would not allow to upload such files, so added the dataset link)

To analyze the data, latest versions of the following libraries are used:

pandas
numpy
chardet
collections
matplotlib

Ensure that the data files are in the same folder as the jupyter notebook, and then "Run all" would allow to execute the complete notebook.
